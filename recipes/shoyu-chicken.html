        <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place 1 cup water, 3/4 cup shoyu,
                1/4 cup packed light brown sugar,
                1/4 cup mirin, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
                in a large pot or Dutch oven. Bring to a simmer
                over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the following, adding each to the pot
                as you complete it: Peel 4 garlic cloves. Smash a 3-inch 
                piece of ginger with the flat side of a knife. Halve 4 medium scallions.
            </li>
            <li>Add 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs to the pot skin-side down
                in an even layer (they can overlap). Cover and reduce the heat to 
                medium-low. Simmer for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Uncover and flip the chicken thighs so that they are skin-side up, arranging
                them into a single layer. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a simmer so
                that the bubbles between but not up and over the pieces of chicken. Simmer
                uncovered until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Spoon off any fat from the surface
                of the sauce if desired. Serve the chicken and sauce with cooked white rice.
